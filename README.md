## Kyle Note 20/01/2017
Added in a very basic level and menu system, this needs to be redesigned a bit, the current implementation is very 'crude' but it is a starting 
point to work with. I am also currently unsure how to test it, will look into potential test cases. 

## Joshua Note 03/02/2017
Begun looking into Node.js and Socket.io for networking element of this program. Will begin coding for this sooner rather than later.
